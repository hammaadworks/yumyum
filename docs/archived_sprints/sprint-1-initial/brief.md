### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Considerations (Revised)

_Initial thoughts on the technical stack and architecture. These are preferences and subject to change upon architectural review._

#### **Platform & Performance Requirements**

- **Target Platforms:** Mobile-first web application.
- **Accessibility:** Must be accessible via a QR code scan on all modern mobile browsers. An offline fallback is desired, pending feasibility analysis.
- **Performance:** A "blazing-fast," app-like user experience is a core product requirement.

#### **Technology Preferences (v3 - Final)**

- **Frontend:** Next.js, React.
- **UI Libraries:** Shadcn UI, Aceternity UI, Magic UI.
- **Backend (Data Source):** A **public** Google Sheet. Data will be fetched as CSV via the `gviz/tq?tqx=out:csv` URL endpoint.
- **Hosting:** Vercel.
- **Media Hosting:** ImageKit.

#### **Initial Architecture & Data Model**

- **Analytics:** Google Analytics 4 (GA4).
- **Data Access Method:** The chosen `gviz` endpoint simplifies development by **avoiding the need for the Google Sheets API and OAuth**. The key trade-off is that the vendor's sheet must be publicly accessible ("Anyone with the link can view").
- **Multi-tenancy:** A `vendor_id` will be used as a GA4 Custom Dimension for per-vendor reporting.
- **Data Model (Google Sheets):** The definitive data model is defined in the PRD. The structure consists of an `Admin_Config` sheet for mapping vendors and individual vendor sheets containing `brand` and `dishes` tabs. This structure is the single source of truth for development.
