    severity: high
    description: 'The `checkVendorEmailExists` service queries the `vendor_mappings` table by an `email` column which does not exist in the table schema.'
    recommendation: 'The `vendor_mappings` table needs a foreign key to `auth.users` (e.g., `user_id`). The service should query by this ID, not by email. The schema and associated logic must be corrected.'
