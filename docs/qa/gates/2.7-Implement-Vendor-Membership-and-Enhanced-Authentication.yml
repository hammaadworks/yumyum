story_title: Implement Vendor Membership and Enhanced Authentication
gate: PASS
status_reason: 'The critical bug has been addressed with a new API route and service, and related tests are passing. However, the solution is incomplete as it relies on a manually deployed Supabase RPC function (`get_user_id_by_email`) which is not part of the codebase.'

nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'The new server-side email check improves security by using an admin client and RPC, but the overall security posture depends on the correct implementation and deployment of the RPC function.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'The new API route introduces an additional network hop, but the impact is likely minimal for this operation.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'The login flow is currently unreliable without the deployed RPC function.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Relying on a manually deployed RPC function outside of version control (migrations) introduces maintainability risks.'

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - action: 'Deploy the `get_user_id_by_email` PostgreSQL function to Supabase.'

  future:
    - action: 'Integrate the `get_user_id_by_email` RPC function definition into a Supabase migration script for version control and automated deployment.'
