title: "Test Design: Brand Header UI"

### 1. Introduction

This document specifies the test plan for **Story 1.3: Brand Header UI**. The objective is to verify that the `BrandHeader` component correctly renders a vendor's brand information, including their logo, name, description, and a set of conditionally rendered contact links.

### 2. Test Objectives

*   **Verify Correct Rendering:** Ensure all required brand elements (`logo`, `name`, `cuisine`, `description`) are always displayed.
*   **Validate Conditional Rendering:** Confirm that contact/social media links are only rendered if their corresponding data is present in the `brand` prop.
*   **Assess Accessibility:** Check that all interactive elements (icon-only links) have appropriate `aria-label` attributes for screen readers.
*   **Test Status Indicator:** Verify that the gradient ring (status indicator) around the logo is displayed when a status is available and hidden when it is not.
*   **Validate Prop Handling:** Ensure the component correctly consumes the `brand` prop.

### 3. Test Scope

*   **In Scope:**
  *   Unit tests for the `BrandHeader` component.
  *   Testing with various `brand` object shapes (with all fields, with only required fields).
  *   Mocking any child components or external dependencies (like icons) if necessary.
*   **Out of Scope:**
  *   End-to-end testing of the entire vendor page.
  *   Testing the actual navigation behavior of the links.

### 4. Test Cases

| Test Case ID | Description | Steps | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.3-R-01** | **Render with Full Data:** Provide a `brand` object with all fields populated. | 1. Create a mock `Brand` object with all optional fields filled. <br> 2. Render the `BrandHeader` with the mock object. | 1. The logo, name, cuisine, and description are all visible. <br> 2. All corresponding icon links (payment, whatsapp, etc.) are rendered in the document. |
| **1.3-R-02** | **Render with Minimal Data:** Provide a `brand` object with only the required fields. | 1. Create a mock `Brand` object with only `name`, `logo_url`, `cuisine`, and `description`. <br> 2. Render the `BrandHeader`. | 1. The required information is displayed. <br> 2. **No** optional icon links (like `location_link` or `instagram`) are rendered. |
| **1.3-A-01** | **Verify ARIA Labels:** Render the component with a full `brand` object. | 1. Render the `BrandHeader` with a full mock `brand` object. <br> 2. Query for the rendered links by their role. | 1. Each icon link must have a descriptive `aria-label` (e.g., "Payment Link", "Contact on WhatsApp"). |
| **1.3-S-01** | **Status Indicator (Available):** Render the component with a prop indicating a status is available. | 1. Render the `BrandHeader` with a prop `hasStatus={true}`. <br> 2. Check the class list of the logo's container. | The logo container has the CSS classes corresponding to the gradient ring (e.g., `bg-gradient-to-r`). |
| **1.3-S-02** | **Status Indicator (Not Available):** Render the component with the status prop set to false. | 1. Render the `BrandHeader` with `hasStatus={false}`. <br> 2. Check the class list of the logo's container. | The logo container does not have the gradient ring classes. |
| **1.3-D-01** | **Data Display:** Verify the correct data is displayed. | 1. Render the `BrandHeader` with a mock `brand` object. <br> 2. Query for elements by their text content. | 1. The text for `name`, `cuisine`, and `description` matches the mock data exactly. <br> 2. The `src` attribute of the logo image matches the `logo_url`. |
