Date: 2025-10-28
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 6
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 69/100

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. [SEC-001]: RLS Policy Bypass

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - RLS policies can be complex and misconfigured.
**Impact**: High - Could lead to a vendor accessing another vendor's sensitive mapping data, causing a data breach.
**Mitigation**:

- Implement RLS policy using `auth.uid()` to match the authenticated user's ID.
- Develop a comprehensive suite of integration tests to validate the RLS policy, checking that vendors can only access their own data and not others'.
  **Testing Focus**: Integration tests simulating multiple vendor accounts trying to access each other's data.

### 2. [SEC-002]: Admin API Authorization Failure

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Authorization logic can be improperly implemented.
**Impact**: High - A non-admin user could potentially change a vendor's membership status, leading to unauthorized data modification and potential revenue impact.
**Mitigation**:

- Utilize Supabase's role-based access control to ensure the API endpoint is only accessible to users with an 'admin' role.
- Implement checks within the API logic to verify the caller's role.
  **Testing Focus**: Integration tests attempting to call the admin API with different user roles (admin, authenticated non-admin, unauthenticated).

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                            | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Mitigation                                                                                           |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEC-001  | RLS Policy Bypass on `vendor_mappings` | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     | Implement strict, user-ID-based RLS policies and validate with extensive integration tests.          |
| SEC-002  | Admin API Authorization Failure        | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     | Enforce admin role checks in the API using Supabase's RLS or Edge Function logic.                    |
| SEC-003  | Email Enumeration Vulnerability        | High (3)    | Low (1)    | 3     | Low      | Accepted risk due to story requirements. The system intentionally reveals if an email is registered. |
| DATA-001 | Incorrect Redirection After Login      | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Ensure robust logic for fetching `vendor-slug` and add error handling to the redirection process.    |
| TECH-001 | Database Migration Failure             | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Test migration scripts in a staging environment and have a clear rollback plan.                      |
| BUS-001  | Poor UX for Unregistered Users         | Medium (2)  | Low (1)    | 2     | Low      | Monitor user feedback and support channels to see if the error message needs refinement.             |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **SEC-001:** Integration tests for RLS policies. Create multiple vendor accounts and assert that one cannot read or modify the data of another.
- **SEC-002:** Integration tests for the admin API. Attempt to call the API as an admin, a regular authenticated user, and an unauthenticated user, asserting the correct success/failure for each.

### Priority 2: Low Risk Tests

- **SEC-003:** E2E test to confirm the specified error message is shown for unregistered emails.
- **DATA-001:** E2E test for the full login flow, confirming redirection to the correct vendor dashboard.
- **TECH-001:** Test the migration in a non-production environment.
- **BUS-001:** E2E test to confirm the error message is displayed as specified.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All High risks (score 6) must have their mitigation strategies fully implemented and tested.

### Accepted Risks

- The email enumeration risk (SEC-003) is accepted as a requirement of the story.
