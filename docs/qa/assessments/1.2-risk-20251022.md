## Medium Risks

### 1. [BUS-001]: User drop-off due to context switching

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - It's possible some users on desktop won't complete the action if they don't have WhatsApp installed or are hesitant to leave the site.
**Impact**: Medium (2) - A potential lead is lost, which impacts the primary conversion goal of this feature.
**Mitigation**:

- **Strategy**: Monitor
- **Actions**: Track the `premium_cta_clicked` GA event to measure engagement before and after the change. If a significant drop is observed, reconsider the UX flow (e.g., a hybrid approach with a small info modal first).
- **Testing Focus**: E2E tests should confirm the click action works seamlessly. Analytics testing must confirm the event fires correctly.

| :------- | :------------------------------------------- | :---------- | :---------- | :--------- | :---- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BUS-001  | User drop-off due to context switching       | Business    | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Monitor analytics for engagement changes.                                     |
| TECH-001 | Hardcoded constants limit flexibility        | Technical   | High (3)    | Low (1)    | 3     | Low      | Accept for now; consider env variables if multi-env complexity increases.     |
| SEC-001  | Business phone number exposed                | Security    | High (3)    | Low (1)    | 3     | Low      | Accept risk; the number is a public-facing business contact point.            |
| OPS-001  | Incorrect URL construction/encoding          | Operational | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Cover with P0 unit tests for URL generation logic.                            |
| PERF-001 | Minor bundle size increase from icon library | Performance | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Minimal  | Rely on build tool tree-shaking. Monitor bundle size if it becomes a concern. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Tests

- **Test ID**: 1.2-E2E-001
- **Scenario**: User successfully navigates from landing page to WhatsApp.
- **Rationale**: Validates the main conversion path and ensures the UX change doesn't completely break the flow.

### Priority 2: Low Risk Tests

- **Test ID**: 1.2-UNIT-002
- **Scenario**: URL construction logic is correct.
- **Rationale**: Directly mitigates `OPS-001` by ensuring the generated link is valid.

## Gate Recommendation

Based on the risk profile, the recommendation is **CONCERNS** due to the medium-level business risk (BUS-001). The feature can proceed, but the product owner should be aware of the potential impact on conversion and the need to monitor it post-release.
