### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for **Story 2.2: Center Media Display**. The objective is to verify that the `MediaDisplay` component correctly renders either a video or an image for a given dish, based on the presence of a `reel` URL in the dish data.

### 2. Test Objectives

*   **Verify Conditional Rendering:** Ensure the component renders a `<video>` element if a `reel` URL is provided, and an `<img>` element otherwise.
*   **Validate Attribute Correctness:**
    *   Confirm that the `<video>` element has the correct `src`, `poster`, and playback attributes (`autoPlay`, `loop`, `muted`, `playsInline`).
    *   Confirm that the `<img>` element has the correct `src` attribute.
*   **Assess Prop Handling:** Ensure the component correctly consumes the `dish` prop.

### 3. Test Scope

*   **In Scope:**
    *   Unit tests for the `MediaDisplay` component.
    *   Testing with dish objects that have and do not have a `reel` URL.
*   **Out of Scope:**
    *   The actual playback of the video.
    *   The visual styling and centering of the media element.

### 4. Test Cases

| Test Case ID | Description | Steps | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.2-R-01** | **Render Image:** Provide a dish object without a `reel` URL. | 1. Create a mock `Dish` object with an `image` URL but no `reel` URL. <br> 2. Render the `MediaDisplay` component with this dish. | 1. An `<img>` element should be rendered. <br> 2. The `src` of the image should match the `dish.image` URL. <br> 3. No `<video>` element should be present. |
| **2.2-R-02** | **Render Video:** Provide a dish object with a `reel` URL. | 1. Create a mock `Dish` object with both `image` and `reel` URLs. <br> 2. Render the `MediaDisplay` component. | 1. A `<video>` element should be rendered. <br> 2. The `src` of the video should match the `dish.reel` URL. <br> 3. No `<img>` element should be present (other than what might be used internally by a video player library, if applicable). |
| **2.2-A-01** | **Video Poster Attribute:** Render a video for a dish. | 1. Render the `MediaDisplay` component with a dish that has a `reel` URL. | The `<video>` element should have a `poster` attribute that matches the `dish.image` URL. |
| **2.2-A-02** | **Video Playback Attributes:** Render a video for a dish. | 1. Render the `MediaDisplay` component with a dish that has a `reel` URL. | The `<video>` element should have the boolean attributes `autoPlay`, `loop`, `muted`, and `playsInline`. |
| **2.2-E-01** | **Missing Image URL:** Provide a dish with a `reel` URL but no `image` URL. | 1. Render the `MediaDisplay` with a dish that has a `reel` URL but an empty `image` URL. | The `<video>` element should be rendered, but it should not have a `poster` attribute. |
