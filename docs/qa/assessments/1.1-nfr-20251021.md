## Summary

- **Reliability**: PASS - The page is presentational and built with a modern framework. The required unit tests will ensure component-level reliability.

## Critical Issues

There are no critical NFR issues.

## Recommendations

1.  **Define Performance Targets** (Performance)
    - **Risk**: The new components could negatively impact load times, harming SEO and user retention.
    - **Fix**: Add a new acceptance criterion or task to measure Core Web Vitals (e.g., LCP < 2.5s) using a tool like Lighthouse or the Vercel Analytics dashboard.
