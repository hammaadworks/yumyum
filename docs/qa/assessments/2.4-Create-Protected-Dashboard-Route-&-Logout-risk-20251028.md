# Risk Profile: Story 2.4: Create Protected Dashboard Route & Logout

Date: 2025-10-28
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 78/100

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. [SEC-001]: Unauthorized Access to Dashboard

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Protected routes are prone to misconfiguration, especially with client-side vs. server-side checks.
**Impact**: High - Direct exposure of sensitive vendor business data to unauthenticated users, leading to severe privacy and security breaches.
**Mitigation**:

- Implement robust authentication checks at the server-side (e.g., Next.js middleware or server components) to verify an active and valid Supabase session before rendering any dashboard content.
- Ensure client-side checks are for UX only and not relied upon for security.
  **Testing Focus**: Extensive integration and E2E tests simulating various unauthorized access attempts (e.g., direct URL access, manipulated tokens).

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                                   | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Mitigation                                                                                                |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEC-001  | Unauthorized Access to Dashboard              | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     | Implement robust server-side authentication checks for the protected route.                               |
| TECH-001 | Incorrect Redirection Loop                    | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Carefully design redirection logic, ensuring clear exit conditions and proper handling of `/login` route. |
| SEC-002  | Session Hijacking/Fixation                    | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      | Rely on Supabase's secure session management; avoid custom session handling.                              |
| TECH-002 | Logout Failure (Session Not Invalidated)      | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Use Supabase's official `signOut` method and verify session invalidation post-logout.                     |
| BUS-001  | Poor User Experience on Logout (Bad Redirect) | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Minimal  | Ensure logout redirects to a user-friendly public page (e.g., `/login` or home).                          |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **SEC-001:** E2E tests to verify that direct access to `/[vendor_slug]/dashboard` as an unauthenticated user redirects to `/login`. Integration tests for the protected layout/middleware to ensure session checks are correctly applied.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **TECH-001:** Integration and E2E tests to simulate redirection scenarios, ensuring no infinite loops occur when accessing protected routes without authentication.

### Priority 3: Low/Minimal Risk Tests

- **SEC-002, TECH-002, BUS-001:** E2E tests for the complete logout flow, verifying session invalidation and correct redirection to the login page.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All High risks (score 6) must have their mitigation strategies fully implemented and tested.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls.
- Low risks with monitoring in place.
