# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 1.1 - Overhaul Landing Page as a Sales Funnel

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: 4
- Fully Covered: 2 (50%)
- Partially Covered: 2 (50%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: The landing page (`/`) is redesigned to function as a persuasive sales page.

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

- **E2E Test**: `1.1-E2E-001`
  - **Given**: A user navigating to the root URL.
  - **When**: The page loads.
  - **Then**: The main landing page content is rendered without errors.

*Note: "Persuasive" is a subjective quality that cannot be fully validated by automated tests. This test ensures the page is technically functional.* 

---

#### AC2: It clearly articulates the value proposition for both free and premium tiers.

**Coverage: FULL**

- **Unit Test**: `1.1-UNIT-001` & `1.1-UNIT-002`
  - **Given**: The `TierComparison` component receives props for the 'free' and 'premium' tiers.
  - **When**: The component renders.
  - **Then**: The correct value propositions and features for each tier are displayed.

- **Integration Test**: `1.1-INT-001`
  - **Given**: The main landing page component is rendered.
  - **When**: The component tree is inspected.
  - **Then**: The `TierComparison` component is present and visible within the layout.

---

#### AC3: The page includes clear CTAs for both tiers, including an "Interested?" button.

**Coverage: FULL**

- **Unit Test**: `1.1-UNIT-003`
  - **Given**: The `InterestCTA` component is rendered.
  - **When**: The component output is inspected.
  - **Then**: A button with the text "Interested?" is present.

- **Unit Test**: `1.1-UNIT-005`
  - **Given**: The `InterestCTA` component is rendered and the GA library is mocked.
  - **When**: The "Interested?" button is clicked.
  - **Then**: The mock GA function is called with the `premium_cta_clicked` event.

---

#### AC4: The design is modern, professional, and aligns with the brand.

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

- **Unit Test**: `1.1-UNIT-004`
  - **Given**: The `PremiumMarketingSection` component is rendered.
  - **When**: The component output is inspected.
  - **Then**: The marketing content for the premium tier is present.

- **E2E Test**: `1.1-E2E-002`
  - **Given**: The landing page is loaded on different viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).
  - **When**: A visual snapshot of the page is taken.
  - **Then**: The snapshot matches the approved baseline, ensuring responsive design is correct.

*Note: "Modern" and "professional" are subjective qualities. These tests validate the technical implementation and visual consistency, but manual design review is required.* 

### Critical Gaps

There are no critical gaps in automated test coverage. The identified partial coverage relates to subjective qualities of the design that should be validated manually through User Acceptance Testing (UAT) and design review.

### Test Design Recommendations

- **UAT**: It is highly recommended to conduct a UAT session with target users to validate the subjective aspects of AC1 and AC4 (is the page persuasive and professional?).
- **Design Review**: A formal sign-off from the UX/UI designer should be required to confirm brand alignment.
