## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. [BUS-001]: Persuasive Goal is Subjective and Hard to Measure

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - The effectiveness of a "compelling" design is subjective. The addition of analytics helps measure this, but the initial risk that the design doesn't resonate remains.
**Impact**: High - If the landing page fails to convince vendors, it directly undermines the primary business goal of driving sign-ups and sales.
**Mitigation**:
- **Strategy**: Detective & Corrective.
- **Actions**:
  - Leverage the new `premium_cta_clicked` event to establish a baseline conversion metric.
  - Implement A/B testing on key sections (Headlines, CTAs) as a follow-up activity.
  - Gather user feedback on the design from a small pool of target vendors.
- **Testing Focus**: User acceptance testing (UAT) with real potential vendors is highly recommended.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- **[BUS-001]**: Conduct UAT with at least 3-5 potential street food vendors to gauge their reaction to the new landing page.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- **[DATA-001]**: Use browser developer tools or analytics debugging extensions to confirm the `premium_cta_clicked` event fires exactly once on button click with the correct payload.
- **[TECH-001]**: The developer responsible for the refactoring task should perform a peer review with another developer.
- **[TECH-003]**: Perform thorough cross-browser and cross-device testing on the specific breakpoints.

### Priority 3: Low/Minimal Risk Tests
- **[DATA-002]**: Manually verify that any cookie consent banners or privacy mechanisms are respected by the new analytics event.
- **[TECH-002]**: Standard functional testing should confirm that components from the new UI libraries render correctly.
- **[OPS-001]**: Verify that the "Interested?" button is clickable and fires the event, even if no visible change occurs for the user.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- No critical risks identified.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **[BUS-001]**: The risk of low conversion can be accepted for initial deployment, now that tracking is in place to measure its performance.
- **[DATA-001]**: The risk of incorrect analytics can be accepted if manual verification confirms the event is firing as expected.

## Monitoring Requirements
- **Business**: Track the count of `premium_cta_clicked` events in Google Analytics to establish a baseline conversion rate for the CTA.
- **Performance**: Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) for the new landing page.
