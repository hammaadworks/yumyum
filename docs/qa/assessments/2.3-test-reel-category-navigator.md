title: "Test Design: Top Category Navigator"

### 1. Introduction

This document outlines the test plan for **Story 2.3: Top Category Navigator**. The objective is to verify that the `ReelCategoryNavigator` component correctly displays the previous, current, and next categories based on an active index and that it handles edge cases correctly.

### 2. Test Objectives

*   **Verify Category Display:** Ensure the component correctly displays the current, previous, and next categories based on the `categories` array and `activeIndex` prop.
*   **Assess Active State Styling:** Confirm that the currently active category is visually distinct from the others (e.g., has a specific "active" CSS class).
*   **Test Edge Cases:**
  *   Verify correct behavior when the `activeIndex` is 0 (the first category).
  *   Verify correct behavior when the `activeIndex` is the last category.
*   **Test Click/Swipe Handling:** Ensure that selecting a different category (previous or next) triggers the appropriate callback.

### 3. Test Scope

*   **In Scope:**
  *   Unit tests for the `ReelCategoryNavigator` component.
  *   Testing the logic that determines which categories to display.
  *   Verifying the application of "active" and "inactive" CSS classes.
*   **Out of Scope:**
  *   The visual "glassmorphic" effect.
  *   The actual scroll or swipe gesture implementation.

### 4. Test Cases

| Test Case ID | Description | Steps | Expected Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.3-R-01** | **Render in Middle of List:** Provide a list of categories and an active index in the middle. | 1. Provide `categories: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']` and `activeIndex: 1`. <br> 2. Render the `ReelCategoryNavigator`. | 1. Three categories should be visible: 'A', 'B', and 'C'. <br> 2. 'B' (the current category) should have an "active" class. <br> 3. 'A' and 'C' should have an "inactive" class. |
| **2.3-E-01** | **Render at Start of List:** The active index is the first item. | 1. Provide `categories: ['A', 'B', 'C']` and `activeIndex: 0`. <br> 2. Render the component. | 1. Only two categories should be visible: 'A' and 'B'. <br> 2. 'A' should have the "active" class. |
| **2.3-E-02** | **Render at End of List:** The active index is the last item. | 1. Provide `categories: ['A', 'B', 'C']` and `activeIndex: 2`. <br> 2. Render the component. | 1. Only two categories should be visible: 'B' and 'C'. <br> 2. 'C' should have the "active" class. |
| **2.3-E-03** | **Render with Single Category:** The list has only one category. | 1. Provide `categories: ['A']` and `activeIndex: 0`. <br> 2. Render the component. | Only the 'A' category should be visible and it should have the "active" class. |
| **2.3-C-01** | **Click Next Category:** The user clicks on the next (right-side) category. | 1. Provide `categories: ['A', 'B', 'C']`, `activeIndex: 1`, and a mock `onSelectCategory` function. <br> 2. Render the component. <br> 3. Simulate a click on the 'C' category button. | The `onSelectCategory` function should be called once with the index `2`. |
| **2.3-C-02** | **Click Previous Category:** The user clicks on the previous (left-side) category. | 1. Provide `categories: ['A', 'B', 'C']`, `activeIndex: 1`, and a mock `onSelectCategory` function. <br> 2. Render the component. <br> 3. Simulate a click on the 'A' category button. | The `onSelectCategory` function should be called once with the index `0`. |
