# Section 1 of 18: Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the YumYum **Premium Tier**. It details the backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration, serving as the single source of truth for development. This architecture transitions the platform from a simple Google Sheets-based MVP to a scalable, secure, and feature-rich application powered by a robust backend.

## Section 1.1 of 18: Starter Template or Existing Project

This is an evolution of an existing project. The initial MVP was a greenfield application using Next.js and Google Sheets. This new architecture will be integrated into the existing codebase, replacing the Google Sheets data source with a Supabase backend for premium users.
