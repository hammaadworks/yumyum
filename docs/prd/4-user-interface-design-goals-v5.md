# 4. User Interface Design Goals v5

*   **Overall UX Vision:** The UI will replicate the familiar experience of an **Instagram profile page**, transformed into an interactive menu. It must be intuitive, performant, and visually polished.
*   **Key Interaction Paradigms:**
    *   **The Bio Header:** Features the vendor's logo (with status bubble), name, cuisine, bio, and conditionally rendered contact/social links.
    *   **Category Highlights:** A horizontal, scrollable list of circular buttons for each menu category.
    *   **Navtab Icons:** A main navigation bar containing a Cart button, a "Veg Only" toggle, and Search/Sort functionality.
    *   **Dish Grid:** A 3-column grid of dish images. Dishes with a `tag` will have a yellow pulsing dot overlay.
    *   **Full-Screen Reel View:** Clicking a dish opens a vertical-scrolling "reel" interface. Users can double-tap to add to cart, long-press to play video, and open a description drawer. The Sort and Veg-Toggle controls must also be present on this view.
*   **Accessibility:** The application **must** meet the **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** standard.
*   **Branding:** The UI will use modern component libraries (Shadcn UI, Aceternity, Magic UI, React Bits, Pattern Craft, Unicorn Studio) to achieve a premium feel.
