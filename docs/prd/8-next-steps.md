#### **UX Expert Prompt**
> "Please review the finalized PRD in `docs/prd.md`. Your task is to create a detailed UI/UX specification and high-fidelity mockups for the new features, focusing on the Vendor Dashboard (`/vendor/dashboard`) and the updated sales-focused landing page. Ensure the design for the dashboard is intuitive and efficient for a non-technical user."

#### **Architect Prompt**
> "Please review the finalized PRD in `docs/prd.md`. Your task is to create the technical architecture document for the Premium Tier. Pay close attention to the 'Free Tier Maximization' principle and the multi-account strategy for Supabase and ImageKit. Please define the implementation details for the Magic Link authentication flow, the database schema, and the APIs required for the vendor dashboard."
