### **Functional Requirements**

*   **FR1:** The system shall allow a vendor to manage their complete menu via a structured Google Sheet.
*   **FR2:** The system shall generate a unique, publicly accessible brand page for each vendor based on a `vendor_slug`.
*   **FR3:** The brand page shall display the menu in a responsive, 3-column grid of dish images.
*   **FR4:** Clicking a dish in the grid shall open a full-screen, vertical-scrolling "Reel View".
*   **FR5:** Users shall be able to add an item to the cart by double-tapping it in the "Reel View".
*   **FR6:** End-users shall be able to trigger an order by sending the formatted cart contents to the vendor's specified WhatsApp number.
*   **FR7:** The system shall provide a downloadable QR code that links directly to the vendor's brand page.
*   **FR8:** The system shall include a feedback mechanism allowing users to provide a star rating (1-5).
*   **FR9:** If the feedback rating is high (â‰¥ 4 stars), the system shall prompt the user to leave a review on the vendor's specified social media page.
*   **FR10:** The system shall provide a `/vendor/upload` page allowing vendors to upload images/videos to Cloudinary and receive a URL.
*   **FR11:** A "Veg Only" toggle in the UI shall filter the `Dishes` list on the client-side.
*   **FR12:** The UI shall provide a mechanism to sort the menu by price (low-to-high / high-to-low).
*   **FR13:** A daily scheduled job shall run to find and delete any media in Cloudinary that is no longer referenced in any vendor's Google Sheet.
*   **FR14:** The system shall filter items based on the `instock` field. Items marked `hide` will not be fetched. Items marked `no` will be displayed last in any list and visually greyed out.

### Non-Functional Requirements
