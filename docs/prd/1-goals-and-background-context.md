# 1. Goals and Background Context

### **Goals**
*   Validate product-market fit by onboarding 5+ paying vendors within one month.
*   Prove the core value proposition by achieving a 0% churn rate in the first month.
*   Confirm technical stability and usability of the core product loop.
*   Establish a "Build in Public" brand strategy to drive organic growth and attract opportunities.

### **Background Context**
YumYum is a mobile-first digital menu platform designed for hyperlocal food vendors who are currently underserved by complex, expensive digital solutions. The project aims to solve the key problems of static printed menus—namely high costs, missed upselling opportunities, and a lack of customer data—by providing a beautiful, easy-to-manage digital storefront. The core premise is that by leveraging familiar tools like Google Sheets and WhatsApp, we can deliver a "radically simple" yet powerful tool that provides immediate ROI to vendors and a modern, engaging experience for their customers.
