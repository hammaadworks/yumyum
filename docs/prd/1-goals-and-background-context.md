# 1. Goals and Background Context

#### **Goals**
*   To launch a new recurring revenue stream by onboarding at least 5 paying vendors to the "Premium Tier" within two months.
*   To validate that an in-app management dashboard is a high-value feature that improves vendor workflow, targeting a vendor satisfaction score above 8/10.
*   To increase vendor engagement and menu dynamism by providing a frictionless, in-app editing experience.

#### **Background Context**
The current Google Sheets-based architecture, while effective for initial onboarding, presents a growth ceiling. It lacks the security and feature set (like secure logins and in-app management) required by maturing vendors. This PRD outlines the requirements for a "Premium Tier" MVP that addresses this by introducing a Supabase backend. This will power a secure, in-app dashboard where vendors can manage their entire storefront, solving their need for efficiency and unlocking a new revenue stream for YumYum.
