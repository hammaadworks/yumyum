# Story 2.7: Implement Vendor Membership and Enhanced Authentication

**Status:** Ready for Review

**Story Statement:** As a vendor, I want my membership status to be tracked and my login experience to be secure and personalized, so that I can access my dashboard efficiently and administrators can manage my membership.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The `vendor_mappings` table in the primary Supabase project is updated to include `membership_fee` (real, default 0), `membership_validity` (date, default current date + 10 days), and `is_member` (boolean, default true).
2.  RLS policies are implemented for the `vendor_mappings` table to ensure vendors can only access their own mapping data.
3.  The login page (`/login`) implements the enhanced magic link authentication flow:
    *   Upon email submission, the system first checks if the email exists in `vendor_mappings`.
    *   If the email is not found, an error message ("This email is not registered with YumYum. Please contact support if you believe this is an error.") is displayed, and no magic link is sent. A "Go Home" button is also displayed.
    *   If the email is found, a magic link is sent via Supabase.
4.  Upon successful authentication via magic link, the user is redirected to `/{vendor-slug}/dashboard`, where `vendor-slug` is retrieved from `vendor_mappings`.
5.  APIs are developed within the YumYum admin panel to update the `is_member` field in the `vendor_mappings` table for a given vendor.
6.  The admin APIs for `is_member` management ensure proper authentication and authorization for admin users.

## Dev Notes

### Tips

* Tests are available in `__tests__` directories.
* Ask clarification questions when ambitious.
* Read and understand the project structure, don't write redundant code clutter instead reuse code.
* Use SOLID principles and clean code practices.

### Data Models
*   **`VendorMapping` TypeScript Interface:**
    ```typescript
    export type BackendType = 'supabase' | 'gsheets';

    export interface VendorMapping {
      id: number;
      vendor_slug: string; // e.g., 'the-burger-den'
      backend_type: BackendType; // 'supabase' or 'gsheets'
      supabase_project_id?: string; // Which of the 4 Supabase projects
      gsheet_id?: string;
      imagekit_account_id: string; // Which of the 4 ImageKit accounts
      membership_fee: number;
      membership_validity: string; // ISO 8601 date string
      is_member: boolean;
    }
    ```
    [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#vendor_mappings]

*   **`public.vendor_mappings` SQL Schema:**
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE public.vendor_mappings (
      id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
      vendor_slug text NOT NULL UNIQUE,
      backend_type text NOT NULL, -- 'supabase' or 'gsheets'
      supabase_project_id text,
      gsheet_id text,
      imagekit_account_id text NOT NULL,
      membership_fee real DEFAULT 0,
      membership_validity date DEFAULT (now() + '10 days'::interval),
      is_member boolean DEFAULT true,
      created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
    );
    ```
    [Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md#public.vendor_mappings]

### API Specifications
*   No specific API endpoints are defined in the architecture for the admin panel `is_member` management, but they should follow REST principles and integrate with Supabase for data persistence.
*   Supabase Auth `signInWithOtp` will be used for magic link generation.
    [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#Authentication]

### Component Specifications
*   The `/login` page will require UI elements to display the error message and a "Go Home" button when an email is not found in `vendor_mappings`.
*   The admin panel will require UI components (forms, buttons) to manage the `is_member` status for vendors.
*   Components should follow `shadcn/ui` pattern, using `React.forwardRef` and `cn` utility.
    [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#Component Structure]

### File Locations
*   Authentication logic should reside in `/src/services` to abstract Supabase client calls.
    [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#Data Fetching]
*   New UI components for login error handling and admin panel membership management should be placed in `/src/components`.
*   Database migration scripts for `vendor_mappings` updates should be managed appropriately (e.g., `supabase/migrations`).

### Testing Requirements
*   **Unit Tests:**
    *   Test the logic for checking email against `vendor_mappings`.
    *   Test the redirection logic after successful login.
    *   Test the admin API functions for updating `is_member`.
    [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#Unit Tests]
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   Test the complete login flow, including email verification and redirection.
    *   Test the interaction between the admin UI and the `is_member` update API.
    [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#Integration Tests]
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**
    *   Verify a vendor can successfully log in with a registered email and be redirected to their dashboard.
    *   Verify an unregistered email fails to log in and displays the correct error message.
    *   Verify an administrator can update a vendor's `is_member` status via the admin panel.
    [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#End-to-End (E2E) Tests]

### Technical Constraints
*   All authentication handled by Supabase Auth.
    [Source: architecture/15-security-and-performance.md#Authentication]
*   Environment variables (`.env.local`) must be used for sensitive keys.
*   Type safety must be maintained; `any` is discouraged.
    [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#Type Safety]

### Security Considerations
*   **RLS for `public.vendor_mappings`:** RLS policies must be implemented to restrict vendors to viewing and managing only their own mapping data.
    [Source: architecture/15-security-and-performance.md#Authorization]

1.  **Database Schema Update (AC: 1, 2)**
    *   [x] Modify `supabase/migrations` to update the `public.vendor_mappings` table with `membership_fee`, `membership_validity`, and `is_member` columns, including default values.
    *   [x] Implement RLS policies for `public.vendor_mappings` to ensure row-level security based on vendor ownership.
    *   [x] Write unit tests for RLS policies to verify correct access control.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The review is **BLOCKED** due to two critical issues:
1.  **Failing Tests:** The DoD checklist explicitly notes that two tests are failing. This is a hard stop for any quality review.
2.  **Critical Bug:** The core logic for checking if a vendor email exists is flawed. The code queries for an `email` column in `vendor_mappings`, but this column does not exist in the schema. This means the primary feature of this story is non-functional.

### Refactoring Performed

None. No refactoring was performed due to the blocking issues.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✗]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✗] (Tests are failing and do not cover the actual logic due to the schema bug).
- All ACs Met: [✗] (AC-3 is not met due to the critical bug).

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Fix the two failing tests noted in the DoD checklist.
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Correct the database schema and service logic for vendor lookup. The `vendor_mappings` table should have a `user_id` foreign key referencing `auth.users`. The `checkVendorEmailExists` and `getVendorSlug` functions must be updated to use this relationship instead of querying by a non-existent `email` column.

### Security Review

A full security review is blocked. However, the planned implementation of RLS and admin-level API protection appears sound in the tests, but cannot be confirmed as working.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → `docs/qa/gates/2.7-Implement-Vendor-Membership-and-Enhanced-Authentication.yml`

### Recommended Status

[✗] **Changes Required** - The story should be returned to development to address the critical blocking issues.
