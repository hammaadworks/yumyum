### Story Statement

As a user, I want to see the vendor's brand information, including their logo, name, and contact details, so that I can easily identify them and access their information.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A `BrandHeader` component is created that accepts the `brand` data object as a prop.
2.  The vendor's `logo_url` is displayed as a circular image. The logo has a colored gradient ring around it (similar to an Instagram Story) to indicate a "status" is available to view.
3.  The vendor's `name`, `cuisine`, and `description` are displayed prominently.
4.  A container of icon-only buttons is rendered for each of the following fields present in the `brand` data: `payment_link`, `whatsapp`, `contact`, `location_link`, `instagram`, `facebook`, `youtube`, and `custom`.
5.  Buttons for optional links (e.g., `location_link`, `instagram`) are only rendered if a URL is provided in the data.
6.  The container for the link icons must wrap its content, allowing the icons to flow into multiple rows on smaller screens.
7.  All interactive elements (links, buttons) have appropriate `aria-labels` and the component structure follows semantic HTML to meet accessibility standards.

### Dev Notes

#### Technical Specifications

*   **Component:** `BrandHeader` [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Section-6`]
*   **Data Model:** The component will accept a `Brand` object as a prop. [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Section-4`]
*   **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS for styling. The component should be responsive. [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Section-3`]
*   **Icons:** Use icons from the `lucide-react` library for the contact links (e.g., `Wallet`, `MessageSquare`, `MapPin`). [Source: `docs/ui_init.md`]
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure all links have `aria-label` attributes for screen readers. [Source: `docs/prd.md#NFR9`]

#### File Locations

*   **Component:** `apps/client/src/components/shared/brand-header.tsx` [Source: `docs/ui-architecture.md#Section-3`]
*   **Types:** `apps/client/src/lib/types.ts` [Source: `docs/ui-architecture.md#Section-3`]

### Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **(AC: 1)** Create the `brand-header.tsx` file.
2.  **(AC: 1)** Define the component to accept a `brand: Brand` prop.
3.  **(AC: 2, 3)** Implement the JSX to display the logo, name, cuisine, and description.
4.  **(AC: 4, 5)** Create a mapping of brand link keys (e.g., `payment_link`) to Lucide icons.
5.  **(AC: 4, 5, 6)** Render the icon links conditionally, only if the corresponding data exists in the `brand` prop. Ensure the container wraps on small screens.
6.  **(AC: 7)** Add `aria-label` attributes to all icon-only buttons.
7.  **Test (Integration):** Write tests to verify:
    *   The component renders correctly with a full `brand` object.
    *   Optional links are not rendered when their data is missing.
    *   `aria-label`s are present on all rendered links.

### Dev Agent Record

**Completion Notes:**

*   **Implementation:** Created the `BrandHeader` component in `apps/client/src/components/shared/brand-header.tsx`.
*   **Functionality:** The component correctly renders all required brand information and conditionally displays icon links for optional fields. It also displays a gradient ring around the logo when the `hasStatus` prop is true, as required.
*   **Styling:** Used Tailwind CSS for styling, ensuring the component is responsive and visually aligned with the project's aesthetic. The icon link container uses `flex-wrap` to handle multiple links on smaller screens.
*   **Accessibility:** All icon-only links have descriptive `aria-label` attributes to ensure they are accessible to screen readers.
*   **Testing:** Developed a comprehensive test suite in `src/__tests__/components/shared/brand-header.test.tsx` that covers all acceptance criteria, including rendering, conditional logic, and accessibility. All tests are passing.
