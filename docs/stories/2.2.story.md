### Story Statement

As a user browsing the Reel View, I want to see a large, clear image or video of the dish, so I can have a visually appealing experience.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A `MediaDisplay` component is created that takes a single dish object as a prop.
2.  If the dish object contains a `reel` URL, the component must render a video player that loops the video automatically.
3.  The dish's `image` URL must be used as the video's `poster`â€”a static image shown while the video is loading.
4.  If the dish object does **not** contain a `reel` URL, the component must render the static `image` instead.
5.  The media should fill the available center space of the Reel View, maintaining its aspect ratio.

### Dev Notes

#### Technical Specifications

*   **Component:** `MediaDisplay`. This component is responsible for the primary visual content within each slide of the `ReelView`.
*   **Conditional Rendering:** The core of this component is a conditional check on the `dish.reel` property to determine whether to render an `<video>` or an `<img>` element.
*   **Video Player:** The `<video>` element should have the `autoPlay`, `loop`, `muted`, and `playsInline` attributes to ensure a seamless, Instagram-like experience.
*   **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS to ensure the media is centered and scales correctly while maintaining its aspect ratio (e.g., using `object-contain` or `object-cover`).

#### File Locations

*   **Component:** `apps/client/src/components/features/reel/MediaDisplay.tsx` (inferred)

### Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **(AC: 1)** Create the `MediaDisplay.tsx` component file. It should accept a `dish: Dish` prop.
2.  **(AC: 2, 4)** Implement the conditional rendering logic based on the presence of `dish.reel`.
3.  **(AC: 2)** If rendering a video, ensure the `src` is set to the `reel` URL and include the necessary attributes (`autoPlay`, `loop`, `muted`, `playsInline`).
4.  **(AC: 3)** For the video element, set the `poster` attribute to the `dish.image` URL.
5.  **(AC: 4)** If rendering an image, ensure the `src` is set to the `dish.image` URL.
6.  **(AC: 5)** Apply CSS classes to the media element to ensure it is centered and sized appropriately within its container.
7.  **Test (Integration):** Write tests to verify:
    *   An `<img>` tag is rendered when `reel` is not provided.
    *   A `<video>` tag is rendered when `reel` is provided.
    *   The `<video>` tag has the correct `poster` attribute.
