### Story Statement

As a user in the Reel View, I want to access actions like filtering, sharing, and seeing more details about a dish through a clear set of buttons.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A `ReelActionBar` component is created and displayed vertically on the **right** side of the Reel View.
2.  The bar contains three buttons in the following top-to-bottom order: **Filter**, **Description**, **Share**.
3.  Clicking the "Filter" button opens a bottom sheet drawer containing the "Sort by Price" and "Veg Only" controls.
4.  Clicking the "Share" button opens the device's native share drawer, pre-populated with a direct link to the current dish.
5.  Clicking the "Description" button opens a bottom sheet drawer displaying all relevant dish data, including its `name`, `description`, `price`, and `tag`.
6.  All drawers can be dismissed by swiping down. The Description drawer can **also** be dismissed by tapping the background area outside the drawer.
7.  The action bar and the drawers must have a "glassmorphic" design.

### Dev Notes

#### Technical Specifications

*   **Components:** This will involve creating a `ReelActionBar` component and at least two drawer components (one for Filters, one for Description). `shadcn-ui`'s `Drawer` component can be used as a foundation.
*   **Icons:** Use icons from `lucide-react` for the action buttons (e.g., `Filter`, `Share`, `Info`).
*   **Styling:** The action bar should be a vertical flex container. The drawers and the bar itself should have a glassmorphic effect. [Source: `docs/prd.md#Story-2.4`]
*   **Interaction:** The opening/closing of drawers will be managed by local component state or a UI Zustand store.

#### File Locations

*   **Action Bar:** `apps/client/src/components/features/reel/ReelActionBar.tsx` (inferred)
*   **Drawers:** `apps/client/src/components/features/reel/drawers/` (new directory, inferred)

### Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **(AC: 1)** Create the `ReelActionBar.tsx` component file.
2.  **(AC: 2)** Add three icon buttons to the action bar in the correct order.
3.  **(AC: 3)** Create a `FilterDrawer` component. When the "Filter" button is clicked, this drawer should be displayed. It should contain the controls from the `ControlsBar` (Story 1.5).
4.  **(AC: 5)** Create a `DescriptionDrawer` component that accepts a `dish: Dish` prop. When the "Description" button is clicked, this drawer should be displayed, showing the details of the current dish.
5.  **(AC: 4)** Implement the "Share" button's `onClick` handler to use the Web Share API (`navigator.share`) to share a link to the current dish.
6.  **(AC: 6)** Ensure the `Drawer` components from `shadcn-ui` are configured to be dismissible via swipe.
7.  **(AC: 7)** Apply glassmorphic styling to all created components.
8.  **Test (Integration):** Write tests to verify:
    *   Clicking each action button opens the correct corresponding drawer or triggers the share API.
    *   The `DescriptionDrawer` displays the correct dish information.
