### Story Statement

As a user in the Reel View, I want to see the current category I am browsing and be able to swipe between categories, so I can easily navigate the menu.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A `ReelCategoryNavigator` component is created.
2.  It displays a maximum of three category names at a time: the previous category, the current category, and the next category.
3.  The component has a "glassmorphic" design, with the text appearing transparent or semi-transparent.
4.  The current category is displayed in the center and is visually distinct (e.g., brighter white).
5.  The previous and next categories are displayed to the left and right and are visually faded.
6.  The user can horizontally swipe this navigator to scroll through the categories.
7.  The navigator's state is synced with the main vertical scroll of the Reel View (this will be fully implemented in Story 2.6, but the component must be built to support it).

### Dev Notes

#### Technical Specifications

*   **Component:** `ReelCategoryNavigator`. This component will display the context of where the user is in the menu.
*   **Data:** The component will need the full list of ordered categories and the currently active category index as props.
*   **UI/UX:** The key is the glassmorphic design and the sliding animation. The component should show a "peek" of the previous and next items. The active item in the center should be visually emphasized.
*   **Interaction:** While the full sync with the vertical scroll is in a future story, the component should be built to handle horizontal swiping gestures (e.g., using a library like `framer-motion`).

#### File Locations

*   **Component:** `apps/client/src/components/features/reel/ReelCategoryNavigator.tsx` (inferred)

### Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **(AC: 1)** Create the `ReelCategoryNavigator.tsx` component file.
2.  **(AC: 2)** Define the component to accept `categories: string[]` and `activeIndex: number` as props.
3.  **(AC: 2, 4, 5)** Implement the logic to determine the previous, current, and next categories to display based on the `activeIndex`.
4.  **(AC: 3)** Style the component with a glassmorphic background and transparent text effect.
5.  **(AC: 4, 5)** Apply styles to differentiate the active (center) category from the inactive (side) categories.
6.  **(AC: 6)** Implement the horizontal scrolling/swiping behavior. A simple overflow scroll can be used initially, with a more advanced gesture-based solution to be added later if needed.
7.  **Test (Integration):** Write tests to verify:
    *   The correct three categories are displayed for a given `activeIndex`.
    *   The center category has the correct "active" styling.
    *   It handles edge cases gracefully (e.g., when the active index is 0 or the last item).
