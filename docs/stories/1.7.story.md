### Story Statement

As a user, I want to see a persistent cart icon that shows how many items I have added, so I can easily access my order at any time.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A `GlobalCart` component is created.
2.  The component is displayed in the top-left of the screen layout.
3.  It contains a cart icon.
4.  A badge is displayed on the icon showing the current number of items in the cart. The badge should be hidden if the cart is empty.
5.  Clicking this button initiates the checkout process by opening the "Cart Summary" bottom sheet drawer.

### Dev Notes

#### Technical Specifications

*   **Component:** `GlobalCart` will be a shared component, likely placed in the root layout of the application to ensure it is persistent across views. [Source: `docs/prd.md#Story-1.7`]
*   **State Management:** The component must subscribe to a global `useCartStore` (Zustand) to get the real-time count of items in the cart. [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Section-6`]
*   **UI:** The component will consist of a cart icon (from `lucide-react`) and a small badge element. The badge's visibility will be conditional on the cart item count.

#### File Locations

*   **Component:** `apps/client/src/components/shared/global-cart.tsx` (inferred)
*   **State Store:** `apps/client/src/store/use-cart.store.ts` [Source: `docs/ui-architecture.md#Section-5`]

### Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **(AC: 1)** Create the `global-cart.tsx` component file.
2.  **State:** Ensure the `use-cart.store.ts` Zustand store is created and provides a way to get the total number of unique items.
3.  **(AC: 3)** Inside the component, subscribe to the cart store to get the item count.
4.  **(AC: 3, 4)** Implement the JSX to display a cart icon. Add a small badge component that conditionally renders on top of the icon if the item count is greater than zero, displaying the count.
5.  **(AC: 2)** Add the `GlobalCart` component to the root layout file (`apps/client/src/app/layout.tsx`) to ensure it is always visible.
6.  **(AC: 5)** Add a placeholder `onClick` handler to the button. The logic to open the Cart Summary drawer will be implemented in a later story.
7.  **Test (Integration):** Write tests to verify:
    *   The badge is hidden when the cart store is empty.
    *   The badge appears with the correct count when items are added to the store.
