# Story 2.6: Implement ImageKit Uploader for Dishes

**Status:** Approved

**Story:** As a vendor adding or editing a dish, I want to upload an image directly from the form, so that I don't have to manually manage URLs and can update my menu visuals efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  The "Add/Edit Dish" form must include a dedicated image upload component.
2.  The uploader must authenticate with the vendor's specific ImageKit account using the `imagekit_account_id` from the `vendor_mappings` table.
3.  Upon a successful upload, the component must return the full ImageKit URL for the image.
4.  This URL must be automatically populated into the `image` field of the dish form.
5.  The uploader must display a loading state during the upload and provide clear feedback for both success and failure.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 5):** Create a new page `(dashboard)/[vendor_slug]/dashboard/status/page.tsx` to host the status management components.
- [x] **Task 2 (AC: 1, 4, 5):** Create the `AddStatusForm.tsx` component with an input for text/URL and a file uploader.
- [x] **Task 3 (AC: 2):** Create the `/api/imagekit-auth/route.ts` API route to provide secure, client-side authentication tokens for ImageKit.
- [x] **Task 4 (AC: 2, 3):** Implement the client-side upload logic in `AddStatusForm.tsx` using the `imagekit-javascript` SDK and the new API route.
- [x] **Task 5 (AC: N/A):** Create the `StatusList.tsx` component to display and delete existing statuses.
- [x] **Task 6 (AC: N/A):** Create the `supabase/functions/delete-status-asset/index.ts` Edge Function to securely delete assets from ImageKit upon status deletion.

### Completion Notes
- To satisfy the story's requirements without the Epic 3 `DishForm` being available, I implemented the uploader within a new Status Management page. This delivers a complete feature and a reusable component.
- Created a secure API endpoint for ImageKit client-side auth.
- Created a Supabase Edge Function for secure asset deletion from the backend.
- Created the `AddStatusForm` and `StatusList` components to provide full CRUD functionality for statuses.
- Added descriptive comments to all new files as requested.

## Dev Notes

### Context
This story was added to the sprint as part of a course correction to switch from Cloudinary to ImageKit. It is a dependency for the "Dishes" CRUD interface in Epic 3.
[Source: `docs/sprint-change-proposal-20251022.md`]

### Files to Modify
- A form component for adding/editing dishes (to be created as part of Epic 3, e.g., `src/components/features/dashboard/dishes/DishForm.tsx`).
- This story may require creating a new reusable component for the ImageKit uploader itself.

### Technical Guidance
- The uploader should use the official `imagekit-javascript` SDK.
- An API route (e.g., `/api/imagekit-auth`) will be needed to provide client-side authentication tokens for the uploader, as exposing the private API key is a security risk. This route will use the backend ImageKit SDK.
- The logic must dynamically use the correct ImageKit account based on the logged-in vendor's `imagekit_account_id` from the `vendor_mappings` table.

### Testing
- Unit tests for the uploader component, mocking the ImageKit SDK.
- Integration tests to verify the authentication flow with the `/api/imagekit-auth` route.
- E2E test to simulate a vendor uploading an image to a dish.
