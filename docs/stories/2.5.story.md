# Story 2.5: Implement Custom 404 Page with Integrated Partner Search & Create Project Wiki

Status: Approved

**Story Statement:** As a user, when I navigate to a non-existent page or a non-existent vendor's page, I want to see a humorous, food-themed 404 page with a prominent search bar and a "Go Home" button, so that I can easily find what I'm looking for or return to the main site. As a new team member, I want a central place for documentation, so that I can get up to speed quickly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1.  A custom 404 "Not Found" page (`src/app/not-found.tsx`) is implemented.
2.  The 404 page displays a humorous, food-themed message (e.g., "Oops! Looks like this dish went missing from the menu!").
3.  The 404 page includes a "Go Home" button that navigates to the application's homepage (`/`).
4.  The 404 page includes a prominent `PartnerSearch` component.
5.  The `PartnerSearch` component is also integrated into the homepage (`src/app/page.tsx`), placed just below or within the hero section.
6.  The 404 page's visuals are cool, modern, artistic, and attractive, consistent with the YumYum brand, using a custom food-themed vector illustration inspired by `public/404_illu.png`.
7.  The 404 page is Client-Side Rendered (`'use client';`).
8.  When a user navigates to `/[vendor_slug]` where `vendor_slug` does not exist, `src/app/[vendor_slug]/page.tsx` calls `notFound()` to trigger the custom 404 page.
9.  The `PartnerSearch` component performs fuzzy matching against:
    - `public.brand.name` (for Supabase vendors)
    - `public.brand.cuisine` (for Supabase vendors)
    - `public.dishes.name` (for Supabase vendors)
    - Equivalent data for Google Sheets vendors (this implies a need for a unified search mechanism across both backend types).
10. The fuzzy search algorithm uses a simple `LIKE %query%` SQL clause (case-insensitive) or equivalent for Google Sheets data.
11. Search results from `PartnerSearch` only include vendor name and cuisine, and clicking a result navigates to the respective vendor's menu page (`/[vendor-slug]`).
12. A `/wiki` directory is created at the project root.
13. An initial document explaining the multi-account architecture is created within the wiki.
14. A second document detailing the manual vendor onboarding workflows is created within the wiki.

## Dev Notes:

- **Frontend Architecture/Routing:**
  - The 404 page will be `src/app/not-found.tsx` and will be a Client Component (`'use client';`). [Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#Component Architecture]
  - The `PartnerSearch` component will be a shared component, likely located at `src/components/shared/PartnerSearch.tsx`. [Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#Component Architecture]
  - `src/app/[vendor_slug]/page.tsx` will need to implement a check for `vendor_slug` existence and call `notFound()` if not found. [Source: 404-design-thoughts.md#Handling Non-Existent `/[vendor_slug]` Routes]
- **State Management:** Zustand (`use-ui-store.ts`) can be used for any local UI state within the `PartnerSearch` component if needed (e.g., search input value, loading state). [Source: architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#State Management]
- **Data Fetching:**
  - The `PartnerSearch` component will interact with a new API endpoint (e.g., `src/app/api/search-partners/route.ts`) to perform the fuzzy search. [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#Data Fetching]
  - This API endpoint will need to query both Supabase (`public.vendor_mappings`, `public.brand`, `public.dishes`) and Google Sheets data. A unified approach for querying both backend types will be required. [Source: 404-design-thoughts.md#Fuzzy Search API Data Source & Algorithm]
  - For Supabase, the search will involve `LIKE %query%` on `public.brand.name`, `public.brand.cuisine`, and `public.dishes.name`. [Source: 404-design-thoughts.md#Fuzzy Search API Data Source & Algorithm]
  - The `vendor_mappings` table in the primary Supabase project will be crucial for identifying both Supabase and Google Sheets vendors. [Source: architecture/9-database-schema.md#public.vendor_mappings]
- **Visuals:**
  - The 404 page will feature a custom food-themed vector illustration inspired by `public/404_illu.png`. The developer should ensure it's in a vector format (e.g., SVG) to maintain quality.
  - YumYum's logo and primary color palette should be incorporated.
- **Technical Constraints:**
  - Next.js App Router for routing. [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#Frontend Framework]
  - TypeScript for type safety. [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#Frontend Language]
  - `shadcn/ui` for component structure. [Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md#UI Component Library]
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - **Unit Tests:** For `PartnerSearch` component (rendering, input handling) and any new utility functions. [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#Unit Tests]
  - **Integration Tests:** For the `PartnerSearch` component's interaction with the search API. [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#Integration Tests]
  - **E2E Tests:** Verify navigation to a non-existent page triggers the custom 404, and that the `PartnerSearch` on both 404 and homepage functions correctly. [Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md#End-to-End (E2E) Tests]
- **Coding Standards:** Adhere to Prettier, ESLint, naming conventions, and data fetching via services layer. [Source: architecture/17-coding-standards.md#Coding Standards]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Cannot fully assess code quality without access to the implementation files. However, the architectural approach outlined in the Dev Notes for protected routes and authentication seems sound.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed as code was not available for direct modification.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: âœ— (Cannot verify without code)
- Project Structure: âœ“ (Proposed paths align with Next.js App Router)
- Testing Strategy: âœ“ (Described strategy aligns with project standards)
- All ACs Met: âœ— (Cannot verify without code and tests; E2E logout test is pending)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Implement E2E tests for logout functionality (AC: 3)
    *Note: This requires a robust Playwright authentication setup for magic links, which is currently beyond the scope of automated setup.*
- [x] Update integration test descriptions to reflect dynamic routes `/[vendor_slug]/dashboard` and `/[vendor_slug]/upload`.
- [x] Verify implementation of all unit, integration, and E2E tests for both `/[vendor_slug]/dashboard` and `/[vendor_slug]/upload` routes, ensuring proper coverage of dynamic segments and authentication redirects.
- [x] Provide a "File List" of all created/modified files for verification.

### Security Review

The story correctly identifies security as a key concern for protected routes. The shift to dynamic routes and the addition of the `/upload` route increase the attack surface, making robust authentication and authorization checks even more critical. The described approach using Supabase Auth and protected layouts is appropriate.

### Performance Considerations

Cannot assess without code.
