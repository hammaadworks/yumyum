### Story Statement

As a user, I want to be able to filter and sort the menu, so I can find the dishes I am interested in more easily.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A `ControlsBar` component is created.
2.  The bar contains a "Veg Only" toggle switch. The state of this toggle is managed globally.
3.  The bar contains a "Sort by Price" control. It defaults to "low-to-high" and can be toggled to "high-to-low".
4.  The bar contains a Search input field. (The search logic itself will be deferred to a later story).

### Dev Notes

#### Technical Specifications

*   **UI Components:** This component will be composed of base components from `shadcn-ui`.
    *   `Switch` and `Label` for the "Veg Only" toggle.
    *   `Button` for the "Sort by Price" control.
    *   `Input` for the search field.
*   **Icons:** Use the `Search` icon from `lucide-react` inside the input field. [Source: `docs/ui_init.md`]
*   **State Management:** The state for the filters and sorting (e.g., `isVegOnly`, `sortOrder`) will be managed in a global Zustand store to allow other components like the `DishGrid` to react to changes. [Source: `docs/prd.md#Story-1.5`]

#### File Locations

*   **Component:** `apps/client/src/components/shared/controls-bar.tsx` [Source: `docs/ui_init.md`]
*   **State Store:** A new store, `use-filter.store.ts` (or similar), should be created in `apps/client/src/store/`. [Source: `docs/ui-architecture.md#Section-5`]

### Tasks / Subtasks

1.  **(AC: 1)** Create the `controls-bar.tsx` file.
2.  **(AC: 2, 3, 4)** Assemble the UI using Shadcn's `Switch`, `Label`, `Button`, and `Input` components.
3.  **State:** Create a new Zustand store to manage the state of the controls (e.g., `vegOnly: boolean`, `sortBy: 'asc' | 'desc'`).
4.  **(AC: 2)** Connect the `Switch` component to the Zustand store, so that toggling it updates the global `vegOnly` state.
5.  **(AC: 3)** Connect the `Button` to the Zustand store. Clicking it should toggle the `sortBy` state between `asc` and `desc`.
6.  **(AC: 4)** Add the `Search` icon to the `Input` component. The input's logic will be implemented in a future story.
7.  **Test (Integration):** Write tests to verify:
    *   The component renders all its child controls.
    *   Interacting with the controls (toggling the switch, clicking the button) correctly updates the global Zustand store.
