# Story 1.1: Overhaul Landing Page as a Sales Funnel

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** potential vendor,
**I want** to see a compelling landing page that clearly explains the benefits of the entire platform,
**so that** I am convinced to sign up or learn more.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The landing page (`/`) is redesigned to function as a persuasive sales page.
2. It clearly articulates the value proposition for both free and premium tiers.
3. The page includes clear CTAs for both tiers, including an "Interested?" button.
4. The design is modern, professional, and aligns with the brand.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1 (AC: 1, 4):** Create a new component `src/components/features/landing/PremiumMarketingSection.tsx` to showcase the premium tier.
  - [ ] **Subtask 1.1:** Use modern UI patterns from Magic UI or Aceternity UI to create a visually appealing and persuasive layout.
- [ ] **Task 2 (AC: 2):** Create a new component `src/components/features/landing/TierComparison.tsx`.
  - [ ] **Subtask 2.1:** This component should clearly list the features and value propositions for both the free and premium tiers in a side-by-side or similar easy-to-compare format.
- [ ] **Task 3 (AC: 3):** Create a new component `src/components/features/landing/InterestCTA.tsx`.
  - [ ] **Subtask 3.1:** This component will contain the "Interested?" button. The `onClick` handler for opening the drawer will be implemented in Story 1.2, but the button should be present.
- [ ] **Task 4 (AC: 1):** Modify the root page component (likely `src/app/page.tsx`) to integrate the new `PremiumMarketingSection`, `TierComparison`, and `InterestCTA` components into a cohesive landing page layout.
- [ ] **Task 5 (AC: 4):** Ensure the entire page is responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints as defined in the project's `tailwind.config.ts`.
- [ ] **Task 6 (AC: 4):** Add unit tests for the new components to ensure they render correctly.

## Dev Notes

### Technical Stack
- **Framework:** Next.js, TypeScript
- **UI Libraries:** Shadcn UI, Magic UI, Aceternity UI
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **[Source: `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md`]**

### Component & File Structure
- New components for this story should be created within `src/components/features/landing/`.
- All new components must follow the `shadcn/ui` pattern using `React.forwardRef` and the `cn` utility for class merging.
- The main page to be modified is the root page of the application. Based on the project structure, this is likely `src/app/page.tsx`.
- **[Source: `docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md`, `docs/architecture/17-coding-standards.md`]**

### Data Models
- This story is primarily focused on UI. Components should be built to be stateless and presentational. No direct data fetching is required for this story.
- **[Source: `docs/architecture/4-data-models.md`]**

### Coding Standards
- All code must be formatted with Prettier and pass ESLint checks as configured in the project.
- Component, file, and variable naming must adhere to the conventions outlined in the architecture documentation (e.g., Components: `PascalCase`, files: `kebab-case`).
- **[Source: `docs/architecture/17-coding-standards.md`]**

### Testing
- **Location:** Unit tests for new components must be placed in a `__tests__` directory co-located with the component (e.g., `src/components/features/landing/__tests__/PremiumMarketingSection.test.ts`).
- **Tools:** Use Jest and React Testing Library.
- **Scope:** Tests should verify that components render correctly given specific props and that all static text content is present.
