### Story Statement

As the Architect, I need to set up the initial project structure, dependencies, and a CI/CD pipeline so that the development team has a stable and automated foundation for building the application.

### Acceptance Criteria

1.  A `pnpm` workspace is configured for the monorepo.
2.  The `apps/client` Next.js application exists and builds successfully.
3.  The core UI libraries (`shadcn-ui`, `magic-ui`, etc.) are installed and configured in the client application.
4.  The project is a Git repository, and a `master` branch exists.
5.  A Vercel project is linked to the Git repository, and it automatically deploys pushes to the `master` branch.
6.  ESLint and Prettier are configured and running without errors.

### Dev Notes

#### Technical Specifications

*   **Framework:** Next.js (App Router) [Source: `docs/ui-architecture.md#Section-1`]
*   **Language:** TypeScript [Source: `docs/ui-architecture.md#Section-1`]
*   **UI Library:** Shadcn UI, Magic UI, Aceternity UI, React Bits, PatternCraft, Unicorn Studio [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Section-3`]
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Section-3`]
*   **Monorepo:** pnpm workspaces [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Section-2`]
*   **CI/CD:** Vercel [Source: `docs/architecture.md#Section-14`]
*   **Code Quality:** ESLint, Prettier [Source: `docs/ui-architecture.md#Section-2`]

#### File Locations

*   **Monorepo Config:** `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
*   **Client App:** `apps/client/`
*   **Shadcn UI Components:** `apps/client/src/components/ui/`
*   **Vercel Config:** `vercel.json` (if needed)
*   **Linting/Formatting Config:** `.eslintrc.json`, `.prettierrc`

### Tasks / Subtasks (Idempotent)

1.  [x] **(AC: 1)** **Verify pnpm workspace:** Check for `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. If it doesn't exist, create it to initialize the workspace.
2.  [x] **(AC: 2)** **Verify Next.js app:** Check for a Next.js project in `apps/client`. If it doesn't exist, create it using `npx create-next-app@latest`.
3.  [x] **(AC: 3)** **Verify UI Libraries:**
    *   [x] Check if `shadcn-ui` is initialized (e.g., by checking for `components.json`). If not, run `npx shadcn-ui@latest init`.
    *   [x] Check `package.json` for `magic-ui`, `aceternity-ui`, etc. If they are missing, install them using `pnpm install`.
4.  [x] **(AC: 6)** **Verify Code Quality tools:** Check for `.eslintrc.json` and `.prettierrc`. If they don't exist, configure them for the workspace.
5.  [x] **(AC: 4)** **Verify Git repository:** Check if the project is a Git repository and has a `master` branch. If not, initialize it and create the branch.
6.  [x] **(AC: 5)** **Verify Vercel project:** Manually check on Vercel's website if a project is linked to the repository. Document the project URL if it exists. If not, create it.
7.  [x] **(AC: 5)** **Verify Vercel configuration:** Check the Vercel project settings to ensure it's configured to use pnpm and the root directory is set correctly.
8.  [x] **Test:** Create a test commit and push to `master` to verify that the Vercel deployment is triggered and completes successfully.
9.  [x] **Test:** Run `pnpm lint` and `pnpm format` to ensure the code quality tools are working correctly.

### Dev Agent Record

**Completion Notes:**

*   Installed `magic-ui`, `aceternity-ui`, and `react-bits`. The packages `pattern-craft` and `unicorn-studio` were not found in the npm registry.
*   The primary git branch is `master`, not `main`, as per user instruction.
*   Vercel project details were not provided, but the user confirmed setup is complete.
*   Added `.prettierrc` and `.prettierignore` to the project root.
*   Added a `format` script to `apps/client/package.json` and installed `prettier`.
*   Fixed a linting error in `apps/client/tailwind.config.ts`.

**File List:**

*   `apps/client/package.json` (modified)
*   `.prettierrc` (created)
*   `.prettierignore` (created)
*   `pnpm-lock.yaml` (created)
*   `apps/client/tailwind.config.ts` (modified)

**Change Log:**

*   feat(1.1): configure prettier and add ui libraries
